            <h2>war ship</h2>
            <p>A warship or combatant ship is a naval ship that is built and primarily intended for naval warfare.
             Usually they belong to the armed forces of a state.
             [1] As well as being armed, warships are designed to withstand damage and are typically faster and more maneuverable than merchant ships.
              Unlike a merchant ship,
             which carries cargo, a warship typically carries only weapons,
              ammunition and supplies for its crew. Warships usually belong to a navy,
               though they have also been operated by individuals, cooperatives and corporations.</p>
